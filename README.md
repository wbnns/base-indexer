# Base Indexer

## Overview

This project aims to build a Base indexer from scratch. The Base indexer reads data from the Base blockchain and organizes it in a database for easy querying and retrieval. This system is designed to provide efficient access to blockchain data, including blocks, transactions, and smart contract events.

## Features

- **Base Node Integration**: Connects with a Base node for accessing blockchain data.
- **Data Indexing**: Efficiently indexes blockchain data into a structured database.
- **API for Data Retrieval**: Offers a RESTful API to query the indexed blockchain data.
- **Real-time and Historical Data**: Capable of indexing both real-time and historical blockchain data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle the growing size of the Base blockchain.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the indexer.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
- `tests/`: Test cases and testing scripts.
- `setup/`: Instructions and scripts for setting up the project.

## Setup and Installation

Detailed instructions for setting up the Base node and configuring the indexer will be provided in the `setup/` directory.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the indexer and the API will be provided once the project reaches a functional stage.
